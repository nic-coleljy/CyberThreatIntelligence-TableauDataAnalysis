            "message": "Nok Air was established in February 2004 under Sky Asia Co., Ltd. and started operations on 23 July 2004. As of March 2007, it had 130 employees and had reached around 1,400 employees by 2014.[3] Nok Air began its first international service on 31 May 2007, with daily flights to Bangalore, India, but suspended these flights in 2020.[4]\n\nNok Air serves the largest number of domestic routes within Thailand, with 24 routes.[5]\n\nNok Air operates largely independently from Thai Airways, which has caused some friction between the two companies. To gain greater control of Nok Air, Thai Airways has tried to purchase the shares of other shareholders, notably Krung Thai Bank. Although Thai Airways and Krung Thai Bank are both state enterprises under the control of the finance ministry, Krung Thai Bank refused to sell its shares in Nok Air to Thai Airways. The purchase would have lifted Thai Airways' stake in Nok Air from 39 to 49%.[6] Evidence of Thai Airways declining interest in Nok Air came in May 2017, when Thai Airways shareholding was diluted to 21.57%[7] as a result of not taking up their entitlement of a new share offering. As a consequence Thai investor, Mr. Nuttapol Chulangkul became the airline's largest shareholder, owning 23.77% of the company.[8]\n\nDue to the preparation process to be listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), the company name had been changed to \"Nok Airlines Company Limited\" on 16 January 2006. Then, at its initial entry to Thailand's stock market, it was renamed \"Nok Airlines Public Company Limited\" (since 18 January 2013) with trading symbol \"NOK\".[9]\n\nIn late 2013, Nok Air announced a joint venture with Scoot Airlines (a low-cost subsidiary of Singapore Airlines) to form NokScoot, a low-cost airline operating medium to long-haul international services, based out of Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok.[10] The joint venture was shut down in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA new company slogan, \"Smiling Across Asia\" was unveiled in June 2016. It hints at Nok's strategy of becoming the dominant regional carrier.[11]\n\nOn December 22, 2017, Mr. Patee Sarasin, the first Nok Air CEO (between 2004 and 2017), resigned from the company's board of directors.[12][13]",

            "description": "Among the various plastics, phenolic resin has the oldest history. It was developed by Dr. Leo H. Baekeland, an American of Belgian ancestry, in 1907 and he named that synthetic resin \"Bakelite\". In 1911, Sankyo Company (currently Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.) was assigned the rights to execute the patents in Japan through the good offices of Dr. Jokichi Takamine, a close friend of Dr. Baekeland. Trial production of phenolic resin was started at the Shinagawa Plant of Sankyo Company. That was the origin of the Japan's plastics industry, and the name of our company came from this achievement.\n\nIn 1932, phenolic resin business of Sankyo Co., Ltd. was separated and formed Nippon Bakelite Co., Ltd. In 1955, Nippon Bakelite Co., Ltd. merged with Sumitomo Synthetic Resin Industries, Ltd. to found Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. As a pioneer in plastics, with our expertise in and up-to-date facilities for plastics, we have been always developing new technologies for use in various fields in order to contribute to establishing safe and comfortable living.",

GMM Grammy's critical sensitive data is downloaded to our servers and encrypted, only we have access to decrypt this data. All data is ready to be uploaded into the public domain automatically in 48 hours after the attack. GMM Grammy has a chance to recover their data and protect their customers and employees from having their data used for criminal purposes. GMM Grammy management is aware of this incident and have all the information they need to contact us.\n\nCritical information of GMM Grammy and its partners, clients, musicians and showbiz stars will be fully disclosed and available to anyone who wishes to access it if GMM Grammy does not contact us within 48 hours.\n\nThe information we have is capable of completely disrupting GMM Grammy's business, severely harming the showbiz stars doing business with them and implicating all GMM Grammy clients in cases of lawbreaking using their personal information. \n\n\nATTTENTION!\n\nGMM Grammy has 48 hours from the time of the attack on them. If they do not contact us within that time, they will face dire consequences for their business and reputation. GMM Grammy management is in full possession of all information to resolve this matter and their failure to act will constitute a direct consent to the distribution and criminal use of their customers, show business stars and product users' information.\n\nGMM Grammy management should understand that this incident is just business. Business is about keeping sensitive and personally identifiable user and customer data secure by companies that do not treat it with respect for their customers and their privacy. Having all access to all resources of GMM Grammy (YouTube, Facebook, Google, all accounts of social networks and cloud storages) we did not attack from this side, having all possibilities, this step shows our intentions - to make user data storage by big companies a completely safe process.\n\nAt the same time we can not influence the outcome of this incident as all negative consequences will be launched by GMM Grammy's fault without our participation if GMM Grammy will not contact us and solve this problem within 48 hours. If GMM Grammy does not contact us in the specified time, there will be many negative consequences due to their fault:\n\n- The administration of King of Thailand will be informed about this incident. The King of Thailand will be provided all evidence of GMM Grammy's guilt in this incident and their initiative to use their customers' data to launder money for their own commercial interests\n- The users of the services provided by GMM Grammy through its affiliated companies (TV, film studios, equipment and technical solutions) will be involved in money making in China, USA, Thailand and throughout Asia using their personal data\n- All personal data of the showbiz stars and musicians contracted by GMM Grammy will be made public\n- All technical developments and their descriptions, githubs and source codes will be uploaded to the largest hackers' forums of the world, followed by attacks on all GMM Grammy clients and GMM Grammy's entire product system\n- All legal documents including contracts, agreements, NDA documentation will be made publicly available, and a link to download them will be sent to hundreds of journalists in major media outlets around the world\n- A mass social media alert will be launched all over Asia about the incident, with links to all the materials. Thousands of bots will spread information about the incident to millions of people in Asia\n- All GMM Grammy vulnerabilities will be reported to multiple hacker groups, so if GMM Grammy fails to contact us within 48 hours, they will be targeted in massive attacks.\n\nAt this time, GMM Grammy's management, with all the information about this incident, is making the choices it believes in and is making the decision regarding the security of their clients' data that it wholeheartedly supports. We hope that GMM Grammy's customers will react favorably to this decision, and that their personal information will remain protected. If GMM Grammy makes the right decision and protects its customers' information on our terms, we will provide them with full information about the vulnerabilities in their system with detailed recommendations on how to fix them. Also, if GMM Grammy contacts us within 48 hours of the attack and meets all data recovery conditions, this blog will not be published and they will have the opportunity to fully recover their data and remove it from our servers. If this blog is published, it is proof of GMM Grammy's complete culpability for all the consequences of this incident, as well as their culpability for all the terrible consequences their customers and partners will face.",

            "message": "\nWhat is D\u00f6hler?\n\nD\u00f6hler is a global producer, marketer and provider of technology-driven natural ingredients, ingredient systems and integrated solutions for the global food, beverage and nutrition industry.\n\nD\u00f6hler has a critically low level of security. The storage of company data, personal data, sensetive data of partners is at a critically low level. The same is true for internal processes, policies and production - absolutely all of them are not properly executed and controlled. D\u00f6hler puts its customers, information, processes and consequently the consumers of their products at risk.\n\nThe company has been hacked. The data is encrypted and stored on our servers. At this time we have information that will open the public's eyes to restricted data and help change the way millions of people around the world think about their products:\n\n- Detailed information about product formulations and manufacturing methods\n- Financial records of the company and its partners\n- Information about the company's lonistic chains and contractors\n- Information on so-called supplier farms, detailing the company's methods of working with them\n- Critical personal data about D\u00f6hler employees and management\n- Information on D\u00f6hler product technologies and solutions\n- Databases, backups\n- Industry data and analytics\n- Hygiene and production control data\n- Strategic company and customer data\n- Information that can change the way people around the world think about D\u00f6hler products\n\nWe fully understand that the bigger a company is, the harder it is to keep all processes safe, however in the case of D\u00f6hler we have a company which treats its processes and partners without any responsibility. D\u00f6hler's extremely low level of security will make all its customers aware of the serious risks of doing business with D\u00f6hler. \n\nThe irresponsible storage of partner and customer data (including product recipes, closed patents, NDA documentation, financial documents, business methods) will entail their disclosure and downloading into the public domain. These documents will be available to anyone who wishes to access them.\n\nD\u00f6hler may not understand the complexity of this incident, so the company's global divisions will face serious consequences if they fail to cooperate. A large number of journalists from all over the world will be involved in the incident with full access to the downloaded company data.\n\nAll of the personal data of the company's clients and its employees will be used for criminal purposes, all of these people will have a huge number of problems with the law through the fault of the company. And the company itself would be in direct violation of the fundamental conventions of the International Labor Organization and the GDPR personal data law.\n\nIf D\u00f6hler fails to come forward to resolve this incident within 48 hours - it will be seen as a gross violation of the rights of its customers and consumers, who have a right to know the truth about the food they eat and the approach to its production. Millions of people will know the truth about the food they buy every day in supermarkets and eat in fast-food restaurants of world-famous brands. ",

            "message": "Our team conducted a cybersecurity study of Suffolk County. Findings revealed a significant number of vulnerabilities, which, in turn, led to disruption in Livelihood systems and discomfort for Suffolk County residents.\nAll of this could have been avoided if the common sense and rationality of Suffolk County authorities had been exercised in making decisions. \nUnfortunately, that did not happen. \n\nAccording to a Suffolk County spokesperson, your government spent $6,500,000 between 2019 and 2022 on cybersecurity of taxpayer funds. As we discovered in our research, that spending came down to the Palo Alto government's purchase of the Palo Alto - Cortex XDR system, which was supposed to provide robust protection for the county's computer infrastructure and citizens' personal data. \nYou can see the results of the reliability of this system for yourself. \n\nOur team made a rational suggestion to the Suffolk government to avoid the critical consequences of the county's weak cyber defenses.\n\nOur proposal to the Suffolk government was to pay for our study in the amount of 20% of the $6,500,000 USD that the government had previously spent so foolishly. Specifically, 650000 USD. In addition, we were willing to reduce the cost of our services.\n\nOur team's proposal was to fix the problem within 48 hours. By September 10, all Suffolk infrastructure activity could be back to normal. In addition, by presenting the results of our work in the form of concrete recommendations, we were guaranteed that Suffolk County's cybersecurity could be truly strengthened. And that's for only $650,000 USD. That's a good price. \n\nThe government made a different decision, refusing to even discuss a solution to the problem with us, namely deliberately forcing us to publish confidential information. \nQuestion: Whose interests does Suffolk County government represent? \n\nSo far we have published 25% of the information we have. We are sorry, but today we will continue to publish confidential information regarding citizens of the county, court cases, the sheriff's department, etc.  \n\nHow much credibility can we give to a government that deliberately harms its Population? \n\nTHE CHOICE IS YOURS!\n\nPOST HAS BEEN UPDATED 800GB LEAK AVAILABLE NOW\nhttp://zsiqjukuzkfdhvpj3onvl3vggicia47maatwzluxsqwdau432s2kqrid.onion\n\nhttp://pyjam37kuoepfrcydajrd5on7kdv27kxmkauycs6fnjnbwvmxotsyzad.onion\n\nhttp://m63dgvkqadjlt4xn22ztzpsogtpp5kn3maprvddr4z3yztai6f7ynqid.onion\n",

He made it clear to us that today (6/22/22) negotiations will start between us and the university. But alas, no progress today. We can see that the students are concerned about the incident and we don't want to hurt them. That's why we are not posting the data on our blog yet, because it might hurt them. Which is not to say about the teachers. We are giving this situation one last chance for a constructive resolution. Friday, 6/24/22, 11 p.m. is the deadline. If the university does not contact us, we will post on our blog all the data on students and faculty, as well as the rest of the documents that we have obtained. Have a good days, Mr. Masimo Aguela.

Your servers are lying down again and the network is tightly closed and unavailable. We got more than 80 gb in compressed form of important data city. Don't make past mistakes and do the right thing. This time you won't get away with it. Time. Best regards.\n\n\nUPD: Dear, Channel 5 News KALB. This is for you. Further data leakage will be on your conscience. Your tongue is your enemy. Nothing personal, just business. Best regards. 1 word = 1 mistake = 1 file. Enjoy\n\n\nUPD: Dear Alexandria. What you are doing is wrong. You should have contacted us instead of wasting your time with those around you at the moment. Tomorrow we will post a file tree and you can see what you are missing. Your servers are laid up tight, this is not 2019. Also, don't forget, the longer you don't rebuild your network, the more problems you're going to have in the future. And those around you now won't be able to help you. As a reminder, you have exactly 1 day left to make a decision. Best regards. J_S\n\n\nUPD: Alex...Alex...Alex...Are you still hoping to rebuild the network without us? Ehhhhh...we feel sorry for you...We're posting the file tree so you can understand how important this data is to you. Our next update will be one word. Best Regards.\n\n\nUPD: The entire data is published. Enjoy ",

            "message": "W Anderson LTD is the company which no one should work with- or for-, because of their lowest IT security level.\n\nWe do have a lot of experience in our business field, different corps, various countries.\u00a0\nBut when it comes to the lowest level of any company IT protection, we believe it is our mandatory duty to share our experience, in order for any valuable company to avoid any relations with corps like this one, JW Anderson LTD.\n\nFirst thing which was surprising is the amateur level of \u201cPrimary Protection\u201d. In other words \u2013 hacking this company was even easier than making coffee. Unexpected for us, dangerous for partners of this corp.\n\nSecond surprise \u2013 JW Anderson`s corporate VPN was exposed to the 2018 vulnerability. Feels like their IT admin exists only for existing, no other functionality, no data protection, no protection at all. Good for us, unacceptable for any corp`s client, partner, contractor, etc.\n\nThird surprise \u2013 since we`ve got access to corp`s VPN, almost instantly got access to the Admin Domain. Guess why it was so fast and easy? Simple: because corp`s Administrator password word on \"qwerty1234\" level of security. Applause to JW Anderson`s admin and CEO (Jenny Galimberti).\n\nFourth and final surprising episode - we were negotiating with JW Anderson representative, but at the final step company decided to skip the deal and recover by itself. But they failed. We believe that\u2019s another proof of their IT Admin + CEO collaboration failure, as they always do in IT. Probably admin said \u201cI can! I will!\u201d and CEO wanted just to believe but not to analyze, so accepted admin`s fairy tales.\n\nThis corp made us really happy to see the example of the lowest management and IT skills.\n\nNext steps.\u00a0\n- JW Anderson failed to have a deal with us, so we have no options, but their Data publishing to public bog;\n- We are kindly ask Media to cover this case so many of potential businesses who are thinking to deal with JW Anderson LTD would never do that, because their IT security level is amateur and has no understanding about actual reality.\n\nThanks in advance, hope you enjoyed.\u00a0\n ",

            "message": "Richardson & Pullen, PC, has a long heritage of providing legal services in Allegany County and the surrounding areas. Our firm can trace the origins of its predecessor law practices back to 1827, when Ransom Lloyd (1799-1870) set up a law office in Angelica. The practice was handed down through four generations of the Lloyd and Richardson family, in Angelica and later in Fillmore. Previous incarnations of the firm include Cooley & Lloyd, Lloyd & Pulling, Richardson, Flenagin & Smith, and Richardson, Pullen & Braughtigam. Past and present partners of the firm have variously served the community as judge, district attorney, county legislator and even a U.S. congressman.\nThe current firm was founded by David P. Richardson (1908-1990), who began practicing law in Fillmore with his father in 1940. He was joined by David T. Pullen in 1975, who took over leadership of the firm in 1980 when David P. Richardson retired. Other attorneys have worked with the firm in the years since, and several former partners continue to work in the area in private practice or government service. We remain committed to our community and strive to provide professional and affordable legal expertise with a personal touch and unique understanding of local conditions and issues that cannot be matched by big city firms.",
