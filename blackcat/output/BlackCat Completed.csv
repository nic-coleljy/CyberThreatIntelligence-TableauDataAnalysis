Our firm can trace the origins of its predecessor law practices back to 1827, when Ransom Lloyd (1799-1870) set up a law office in Angelica. The practice was handed down through four generations of the Lloyd and Richardson family, in Angelica and later in Fillmore. Previous incarnations of the firm include Cooley & Lloyd, Lloyd & Pulling, Richardson, Flenagin & Smith, and Richardson, Pullen & Braughtigam. Past and present partners of the firm have variously served the community as judge, district attorney, county legislator and even a U.S. congressman. The current firm was founded by David P. Richardson (1908-1990), who began practicing law in Fillmore with his father in 1940. He was joined by David T. Pullen in 1975, who took over leadership of the firm in 1980 when David P. Richardson retired. Other attorneys have worked with the firm in the years since, and several former partners continue to work in the area in private practice or government service. We remain committed to our community and strive to provide professional and affordable legal expertise with a personal touch and unique understanding of local conditions and issues that cannot be matched by big city firms.",Completed

We do have a lot of experience in our business field, different corps, various countries.  But when it comes to the lowest level of any company IT protection, we believe it is our mandatory duty to share our experience, in order for any valuable company to avoid any relations with corps like this one, JW Anderson LTD.  First thing which was surprising is the amateur level of “Primary Protection”. In other words – hacking this company was even easier than making coffee. Unexpected for us, dangerous for partners of this corp.  Second surprise – JW Anderson`s corporate VPN was exposed to the 2018 vulnerability. Feels like their IT admin exists only for existing, no other functionality, no data protection, no protection at all. Good for us, unacceptable for any corp`s client, partner, contractor, etc.  Third surprise – since we`ve got access to corp`s VPN, almost instantly got access to the Admin Domain. Guess why it was so fast and easy? Simple: because corp`s Administrator password word on ""qwerty1234"" level of security. Applause to JW Anderson`s admin and CEO (Jenny Galimberti).  Fourth and final surprising episode - we were negotiating with JW Anderson representative, but at the final step company decided to skip the deal and recover by itself. But they failed. We believe that’s another proof of their IT Admin + CEO collaboration failure, as they always do in IT. Probably admin said “I can! I will!” and CEO wanted just to believe but not to analyze, so accepted admin`s fairy tales.  This corp made us really happy to see the example of the lowest management and IT skills.  Next steps.  - JW Anderson failed to have a deal with us, so we have no options, but their Data publishing to public bog; - We are kindly ask Media to cover this case so many of potential businesses who are thinking to deal with JW Anderson LTD would never do that, because their IT security level is amateur and has no understanding about actual reality.

Suffolk County government employs 2,001-5,000 people and has $1B-$5B of revenue ",07/09/54676,BlackCat,NA,NA,"Our team conducted a cybersecurity study of Suffolk County. Findings revealed a significant number of vulnerabilities, which, in turn, led to disruption in Livelihood systems and discomfort for Suffolk County residents. All of this could have been avoided if the common sense and rationality of Suffolk County authorities had been exercised in making decisions.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.   According to a Suffolk County spokesperson, your government spent $6,500,000 between 2019 and 2022 on cybersecurity of taxpayer funds. As we discovered in our research, that spending came down to the Palo Alto government's purchase of the Palo Alto - Cortex XDR system, which was supposed to provide robust protection for the county's computer infrastructure and citizens' personal data.  You can see the results of the reliability of this system for yourself.   Our team made a rational suggestion to the Suffolk government to avoid the critical consequences of the county's weak cyber defenses.  Our proposal to the Suffolk government was to pay for our study in the amount of 20% of the $6,500,000 USD that the government had previously spent so foolishly. Specifically, 650000 USD. In addition, we were willing to reduce the cost of our services.  Our team's proposal was to fix the problem within 48 hours. By September 10, all Suffolk infrastructure activity could be back to normal. In addition, by presenting the results of our work in the form of concrete recommendations, we were guaranteed that Suffolk County's cybersecurity could be truly strengthened. And that's for only $650,000 USD. That's a good price.   The government made a different decision, refusing to even discuss a solution to the problem with us, namely deliberately forcing us to publish confidential information.  Question: Whose interests does Suffolk County government represent?   So far we have published 25% of the information we have. We are sorry, but today we will continue to publish confidential information regarding citizens of the county, court cases, the sheriff's department, etc.    How much credibility can we give to a government that deliberately harms its Population?

As of March 2007, it had 130 employees and had reached around 1,400 employees by 2014.[3] Nok Air began its first international service on 31 May 2007, with daily flights to Bangalore, India, but suspended these flights in 2020.[4]  Nok Air serves the largest number of domestic routes within Thailand, with 24 routes.[5]  Nok Air operates largely independently from Thai Airways, which has caused some friction between the two companies. To gain greater control of Nok Air, Thai Airways has tried to purchase the shares of other shareholders, notably Krung Thai Bank. Although Thai Airways and Krung Thai Bank are both state enterprises under the control of the finance ministry, Krung Thai Bank refused to sell its shares in Nok Air to Thai Airways. The purchase would have lifted Thai Airways' stake in Nok Air from 39 to 49%.[6] Evidence of Thai Airways declining interest in Nok Air came in May 2017, when Thai Airways shareholding was diluted to 21.57%[7] as a result of not taking up their entitlement of a new share offering. As a consequence Thai investor, Mr. Nuttapol Chulangkul became the airline's largest shareholder, owning 23.77% of the company.[8]  Due to the preparation process to be listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), the company name had been changed to ""Nok Airlines Company Limited"" on 16 January 2006. Then, at its initial entry to Thailand's stock market, it was renamed ""Nok Airlines Public Company Limited"" (since 18 January 2013) with trading symbol ""NOK"".[9]  In late 2013, Nok Air announced a joint venture with Scoot Airlines (a low-cost subsidiary of Singapore Airlines) to form NokScoot, a low-cost airline operating medium to long-haul international services, based out of Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok.[10] The joint venture was shut down in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  A new company slogan, ""Smiling Across Asia"" was unveiled in June 2016. It hints at Nok's strategy of becoming the dominant regional carrier.[11]  On December 22, 2017, Mr. Patee Sarasin, the first Nok Air CEO (between 2004 and 2017), resigned from the company's board of directors.[12][13]",Completed
